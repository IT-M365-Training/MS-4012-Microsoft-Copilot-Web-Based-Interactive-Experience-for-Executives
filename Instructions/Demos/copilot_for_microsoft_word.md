### Talking Points

In the Interactive Experience, we brainstormed new app or service ideas, created brand identity and marketing assets, and analyzed the competitive landscape. But how can we take this a step further?

With Copilot in Word, we can transform the process of document creation and refinement, enabling you to produce compelling content with ease.

In this demo, we will take the documents we just created and transform them together to create a strategic analysis report. Additionally, we will adjust the format and tone to ensure the content aligns perfectly with our objectives.

### Demo Steps

1. Launch Microsoft Word either on the desktop or by typing **Word.new** in a new Edge tab
